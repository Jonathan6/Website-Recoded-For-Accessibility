## HTML Adjustments
Adjusting the HTML was primarliy replacing all the div's in the file with semantic tags that better described the purpose of the tag in the webpage. This helps increase the accessibility of the website allowing screen readers to easily naviagte through the webpage and improve the website's Google search ranking, giving the company more exposure in search algorithms. 

##  CSS Adjustments
An additional effect of replacing the div's with more descriptive semantic tags is it is easier to use selectors in the CSS. Since there should only be a single footer or header in the HTML, I was able to use tag selectors to make it clearer what is was being adjusted. 

The original CSS showed the drawbacks of not utilizing the cascading effect of CSS with multiple identical rules being applied to tags that could all be grouped together. This made the code long and convuluted causing it be to difficult to read and digest. The updated version is nearly half the length of the original and organized by the layout of the webpage with supporting comments to guide the reader.

## Conclusion
I am pretty satisfied with the final product. It is more accessible, cleaner, and easier to maintain. There are improvements to be made but for a learning experience it has taught me the basic structure of a HTML file within a website and showed why it is important to keep in mind proper semantics when developing a new page.
